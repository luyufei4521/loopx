# Todo continuation and closure readback

Todo list, status and quota distinguish a completed record from a closed work
slice. A completed tracked advancement Todo still needs an existing successor
or an explicit `no_followup=true`. This read policy lives in
`control_plane/todos/succession.ts`; Python normalizes legacy input and renders
its decisions. It belongs to the existing Todo control plane, uses the selected
AuthorityStore, and adds no capability or extension provider.

## Relationship evidence

The policy evaluates the complete available Todo graph before role, status,
Agent, ID or display-limit selection. It recognizes explicit
`successor_todo_ids`, `superseded_by`, and advancement records pointing back
through `unblocks_todo_id` or `resume_when=todo_done:<source>`.

- A declared successor must exist and differ from the source. A dangling or
  self reference does not close work. A retained archived record remains
  relationship evidence; it does not become active work.
- Explicit links retain their existing role-neutral meaning. Inferred
  successors require an advancement task. `monitor_changed` is a resume
  condition, not an inferred work successor.
- An existing successor records continuation lineage. It does not prove that
  the successor has executed, been accepted or acquired a lease. This is not a
  transitive Goal acceptance proof or a cycle-freedom certificate.
- Basic historical checkboxes without structured execution context keep their
  compatibility behavior. Explicit no-follow-up remains an independent closeout
  choice. Deferred work is never classified as a completed advancement gap.

Both completed-work warnings and handoff gates use that same graph. Previously
handoff ignored explicit successor lists, while completed-work warnings accepted
nonexistent/self links. Filtering or archiving a valid inferred successor could
also manufacture a warning that was absent on the full source.

| Handoff facts, in precedence order | State |
| --- | --- |
| Existing, non-self supersession target | `superseded` |
| Deferred source | `deferred` |
| Source has not completed | `blocking` |
| Completed with explicit no-follow-up | `cleared_no_followup` |
| Completed with a resolved successor | `cleared_with_successor` |
| Completed without either | `cleared_without_successor` |

Only active dependency-linked executor exclusions are handoff gates. These
states describe the gate; none changes claims, grants, leases or stored Todos.
The existing legacy stale-closeout prose hint remains a compatibility adapter
until route-closeout writers supply the explicit replan flag. Its substring
matching can overmatch narrative and is not used for successor resolution,
handoff state or permission. An explicit boolean replan flag takes precedence.

## Selection, proofs and transport

A fresh full-source evaluation accompanies each internal summary row. Its fact
digest prevents reuse after relevant item edits; it is a consistency check,
not authentication. Fresh parsing/canonical reads always recompute it rather
than trusting stored evaluations. Shadow capture discards this derived field;
canonical records and durable source digests do not gain a second authority.
Public list/status responses omit the internal evaluation after selection,
retaining the decision fields without expanding the hot-path payload.

A status/ID/Agent-filtered list describes that selection but emits no Goal-source
or terminal-closure proof. A display limit alone does not change the source:
counts, warning decisions and proof eligibility are computed first. Handoff
state, successor count and executor exclusions survive the bounded list view.

Terminal closure additionally requires no deferred/convergent work, unresolved
handoff, successor gap or route-replan obligation. Watch-only monitors retain
the existing convergent-work exception. It remains separate from Goal acceptance.

Field-presence sets are interned inside a succession RPC request so long archive
histories do not repeat identical metadata shapes. The full graph is retained;
no record sampling, per-page rule evaluation or RPC limit increase is used.

## Migration and operation

The shared archive-capture owner retains the reachable continuation graph as
well as resume dependencies and standing decisions. It preserves real record
status, including deferred history: capturing a deferred record does **not**
satisfy `todo_done`. Duplicate identities, invalid archive state and incompatible
role/authority combinations still reject capture. Unrelated archive records
remain outside the bounded canonical capture.

The internal request is `todo_archive_dependency_capture_request_v1`. Python
and the bundled TS runtime must be upgraded together; an older runtime rejects
the new request instead of silently omitting continuation edges. Existing
historical capture/promotion receipts are not rewritten or upgraded in place.
Requalify capture on this runtime before a future promotion.

Use existing read commands; no activation or new option is needed:

```bash
loopx --registry registry.json todo list --goal-id example-goal --format json
loopx --registry registry.json todo list --goal-id example-goal --todo-id todo_source --limit 1 --format json
```

Completion retries also close a receipt/head read race: if the first receipt
lookup misses a peer commit but the head already shows completion, recheck the
matching operation receipt before interpreting a supplied validation receipt.
This returns the committed result without repeating effects; no matching
receipt still follows the existing validation and identity guards.

Reads do not repair Markdown, mutate Todo/lease state or replay a business
operation. Missing promoted Markdown is acceptable; an unavailable provider is
not an empty Goal. No frontend configuration changes are needed: CLI, manager
Chat details and existing status/quota consumers retain their current entry
points. To reverse a business decision, use its ordinary mutation, not a read
model or restored Markdown. Code rollback retains provider state and fences;
old read policies can again misclassify these cases.

## 中文

“这个 Todo 已完成”与“这一段工作已闭环”不同。结构化推进任务完成后，要有真实
存在的后继，或明确声明 `no_followup=true`。TS 现在统一解析显式后继、替代关系和
反向交接关系；Python 保留旧输入规范化与展示。不存在的 ID、自指 ID 不再遮住
未闭环工作，归档与筛选也不再凭空制造后继缺口。

关系在完整可用源上判定，然后才筛选、分页。按状态、ID 或 Agent 筛出的列表不能
为整个源出具闭环证明；仅限制显示条数不会改变完整源上的计数与判断。handoff 的
状态与排除执行者信息不会在压缩展示时丢失。派生判断带相关事实摘要以防陈旧复用，
但不是授权凭据，也不写回 provider。旧 prose replan 提示仍仅用于兼容；显式
布尔标记优先，不能靠标题里的几个词推导后继存在或授予权限。

归档捕获现在保留与当前工作有关的后继图和原有依赖、standing decision。延后历史
可以被保留，但状态仍是 deferred，绝不会因此满足 `todo_done`。新的内部 v1 请求
要求 Python 与 TS 配套升级；旧回执不被重新解释。长历史重复字段集合采用无损共享，
没有放宽 RPC 上限或丢弃历史节点。

本阶段关闭一组 T3/L5 读语义及其 L7 捕获依赖，不代表 D1 投影投递、D2 耐久性、
D3 整 Goal 切换完成，也不修改默认 provider。PostgreSQL 使用相同规则，服务部署与
资格仍独立。复杂 fixture 和只读快照演练不是长期 soak 或生产晋升许可。
